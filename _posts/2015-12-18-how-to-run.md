To start TripleWave, run the `start.sh` file if you are using Mac/Linux, or `start.bat` if you are using Windows.

By default, TripleWave starts on the ports 8114 (stream description) and 8124 (stream distribution), and it converts the English Wikipedia [changes stream](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Recent_changes_stream). To customize the TripleWave behavior, see the Configuration section.

### Configuration file

The configuration file is located in the `config` folder allows to fully customize the TripleWave installation.

### Running the examples

TripleWave comes with three scenarios configured and ready to be run: the web stream transformation case, the replay of the Linked Sensor Data dataset and the endless stream of the same dataset

In order to run the different cases just set the `mode` to `transform`, for the first case, `replay` for the second, and `endless` for the `last`.

In all the cases the sgraph of the corresponding stream will be available at

    http://hostname:port/path/sgraph

As configured in the configuration file.

You can have a look at the stream of the transformation and endless scenario by visiting following links:

* Transformation: [sgraph](http://131.175.141.249/TripleWave-transform/sgraph) -- [HTTP chunk stream](http://131.175.141.249/TripleWave-transform/stream)
* Endless: [sgraph](http://131.175.141.249/TripleWave-endless/sgraph) -- [HTTP chunk stream](http://131.175.141.249/TripleWave-endless/stream) (it make take a while since the events in this dataset come in burst every 5 minutes)
