# R2rml.js


R2rml.js is a js library for using R2RML mappings.

R2rml.js requires rdflib. In order to install it (using node.js):
```
  npm install rdflib
```

To see a small example you can use the CSV sample code in r2rmlcsv.js. It simply uses a CSV file as input and produces triples for a mapping.
